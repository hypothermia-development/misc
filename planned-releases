scary_server_v4, probably not until the next few releases

any rust_rpg content, maybe soon, depends on scary_api, 8-bit computer, and other ongoing projects

inventory_mangement, management software for managing inventory, will most likely have similar structure to scary_server but with scary_api capabilities (i.e reports, notis, etc.)

embedded os - todo when funding and skill is gained
